### My second post ###

    
#### Here is what i did to reach this point. 
 * First I was given instructions on what to learn and how to proceed by our mentor.
 * Then I got familiar with [git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)  and [git hub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)(source code management and repository tools/service).
 * We were then asked to learn [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) (a static site generator) and create a post summing up all we have learnt to reach this point.
 * Then I forked [kmitemagazine.github.io](kmitemagazine.github.io)  github repository into my github acount and cloned the forked branch into my local git and created this post.
 * I was stuck with rebuilding the site and committing on the master branch, then I was explained about how Jekyll build command works which updates the _site directory automatically,which can be commited directly.  
 This guidance by my mentor helped me reach this point.
