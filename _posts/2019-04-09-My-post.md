<h3>My learning process</h3>
<ul>
    
   <h4> Here is what i did to reach this point.</h4>
   <li>First I was given instructions on what to learn and how to proceed by our mentor.</li>
<li>Then I got familiar with <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">git</a>  and <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">git hub</a>(source code management and repository tools/service).</li>
<li>We were then asked to learn <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">Jekyll</a> (a static site generator) and create a post summing up all we have learnt to reach this point.</li>
<li>Then I forked <a href="kmitemagazine.github.io">kmitemagazine.github.io</a>  github repository into my github acount and cloned the forked branch into my local git and created this post.</li>
<li>I was stuck with rebuilding the site and committing on the master branch, then I was explained about how Jekyll build command works which updates the _site directory automatically,which can be commited directly.
    <br>This guidance by my mentor helped me reach this point.</li>
    
</ul>
