&lt;ul&gt;
    
   &lt;h4&gt; Here is what i did to reach this point.&lt;/h4&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;First I was given instructions on what to learn and how to proceed by our mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I got familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/&quot;&gt;git hub&lt;/a&gt;(source code management and repository tools/service).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were then asked to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (a static site generator) and create a post summing up all we have learnt to reach this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I forked &lt;a href=&quot;kmitemagazine.github.io&quot;&gt;kmitemagazine.github.io&lt;/a&gt;  github repository into my github acount and cloned the forked branch into my local git and created this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was stuck with rebuilding the site and committing on the master branch, then I was explained about how Jekyll build command works which updates the _site directory automatically,which can be commited directly.
    &lt;br /&gt;This guidance by my mentor helped me reach this point.&lt;/li&gt;
